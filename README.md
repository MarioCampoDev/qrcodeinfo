- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am a programmer focused on back end, I am entering the world of front end to not be so basic in terms of styles.

For me it was quite a challenge (and very difficult) to get closer to the final result.

Since it is the first time that I enter the front end and it is difficult for me to even do the most basic thing (center an element)

I'm open to any comments, since for such a newbie, I feel like I did well.

Although in many examples work with the body directly. I preferred to work with the section that was going to contain my elements for the challenge.

```css
.qrCard {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    border-radius: 20px;
}

.backCard {
    background-color: white;
    width: 375px;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning to be competent regarding the front end.
